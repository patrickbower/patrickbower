                    The design process is not something I’ve used for many years but the key skills of understanding client needs and articulating concepts is still just as important in my development practice. In particular, the requirement to explain technical knowledge to a broader audience from non technical clients to lead developers. Being a designer gave me opportunity to work in a wide range of disciplines where I enjoyed the process of discovering, experimenting and iterating to find the best solutions which has continued into my development when using new technologies and languages.

                    Solving briefs ranging from creating chart topping album artwork to creating website interfaces has given me the first hand experience to enable me to understand the importance of good design. While I’m no longer a designer, I will always have a passion for how the sites I develop look, feel and function.
