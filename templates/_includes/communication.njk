    Whether Iâ€™m pitching, planning or executing, I enjoy presenting ideas, selling in concepts and engaging in constructive two-way dialogue to bring in different points of view. I have found that listening without bias or judgement and truly understanding what the client wants to achieve enables great work to happen.
