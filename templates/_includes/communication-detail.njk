              Building positive relationships and clear communication are fundamental for collaboration and building trust,  as well as ensuring mutual understanding of goals and parameters. Whether Iâ€™m working alone or in a team, I like to define and distil the problem and use this as the central point upon which ideas and all activities diverge and converge.

              I am confident to lead, organise and execute a project with little or no direction. I often put in place the framework to structure and guide work along a timeline, building in points for feedback. I enjoy presenting to both tech and non-tech types to inspire and explain complex ideas. In terms of leadership, my work can range from organising and facilitating workshops with clients and partners to pushing work with counterparts and teams. I find working with others exciting and it often improves my practice and brings about new understanding for all parties.

              At its heart, my work is both for and with people and I enjoy working, learning and interacting with everyone from users to business leaders.
